# CS50-SQL-course
Repository containing my solutions, schema designs and all files for problem sets within the CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL course from Harvard University.

Key concepts covered in repository's solutions include:
  - Creating, reading, updating and deleting data (CRUD) with relational databases
  - Setting constraints on tables
  - Joining different tables using primary and foreign keys
  - Automating searches with views
  - Improving efficency using indices


All problem sets can be found on [cs50 website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/), along with corresponding datasets, which I do not own
